# Concept Census Extraction Prompt (v3-chunk)

This is the exact prompt a production pipeline sends once per **chunk** of an
episode, with the chunk appended after the `--- TRANSCRIPT CHUNK ---` marker.

Same spec as v2 (three-way `depth`, sixteen types, mechanical mention-emission
rule, explicit ASR handling, per-episode header block), with two changes: the
unit of work is a chunk of consecutive paragraphs rather than a whole episode,
and `char_start` is gone — the pipeline computes character offsets itself from
the verbatim `context_snippet`.

---

You are building a concept census for a wiki derived from *EEVblog*, David L.
Jones's long-running electronics-engineering video channel: teardowns, repairs,
fundamentals tutorials, mailbags, product reviews and industry commentary.
Unlike a two-host podcast this is one person talking to camera, so every
paragraph is labelled `**Dave Jones:**`, there is no interview dynamic, and the
unit of work is a slice of one video rather than one podcast episode. Your job
on this chunk is
**exhaustive inventory, not curation**. Downstream stages handle merging,
ranking and article writing. You only find and label.

## Input format

You are given **one chunk of one episode**: roughly 40 consecutive paragraphs,
not the whole transcript. The chunk opens with a summary line carrying the
episode's frontmatter (`episode`, `title`, `url`, `file`; some legacy episodes
are missing `episode`) and the chunk's number, then the paragraphs themselves.

Every paragraph is prefixed with its **global** index in the episode, in square
brackets, before its speaker label:

```
[p136] **Chris Gammell:** ...text...

[p137] **Dave Jones:** ...text...
```

Use that bracketed number verbatim as `paragraph_index`. It counts every
non-empty paragraph of the full episode body from 0, so the first chunk starts at
`[p0]` and later chunks start wherever the previous one left off. Never
renumber, never index from the start of the chunk. The `[pN]` prefix is
scaffolding, not transcript text — it is never part of a `context_snippet`.

Chunks overlap by one paragraph, so the first paragraph of a chunk may be the
last paragraph of the previous one. Extract it normally; the pipeline dedupes.

`**Speaker ?:**` is a real speaker label used when diarisation failed — treat it
as the literal speaker string `Speaker ?`.

Nearly every video is Dave alone, so `**Dave Jones:**` is the label on every
paragraph and carries no information. Record it as given; never invent a second
speaker because the text sounds like a dialogue (Dave voices both sides of an
imagined exchange constantly). A small minority of videos are interviews or
guest videos; there the labels are as unreliable as any diarisation output —
a paragraph may merge both sides of an exchange under one label, and a stray
label sometimes lands on the wrong paragraph. Always record the label exactly as
it appears, and use the `notes` field to flag a video whose labels are visibly
broken.

## Dave is holding the thing (important)

This is video, and the transcript is only the audio half. Dave constantly refers
to objects that are on screen and unnamed in the text: *"this little guy"*,
*"there's your problem right there"*, *"see that?"*, *"the thing I showed you
last time"*. A podcast never does this, because nobody can see anything.

**Resolve unnamed demonstratives against the video title and the chunk's own
established subject**, then emit the concept under its real name. If the title is
"EEVblog #1234 - Fluke 87V Teardown" and Dave says "so let's crack this thing
open", that is a mention of `fluke-87v`, not a skipped sentence. The same goes
for the device under test throughout a teardown, repair or review: it stays the
subject even in the many paragraphs that never say its name.

Two limits on this. Only resolve a demonstrative when the title or a nearby
paragraph makes the referent unambiguous — do **not** guess a part number that
was never spoken or written. And do not manufacture a mention per pronoun: emit
one when Dave is actually saying something about the object, under the normal
depth rules below.

## Output format

Return **only** a JSON object, no prose, no markdown fence.

**On chunk 0**, emit the full object — the episode header block plus this
chunk's mentions:

```json
{
  "episode": 1234,
  "title": "EEVblog #1234 - Fluke 87V Multimeter Teardown",
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",
  "file": "abcdefghijk.md",
  "main_topics": ["fluke-87v", "multimeter", "input-protection"],
  "guest_name": null,
  "guest_affiliation": null,
  "notes": null,
  "mentions": [ ... ]
}
```

**On every other chunk**, emit only the mentions:

```json
{"mentions": [ ... ]}
```

The episode metadata is repeated on every chunk so you always know what episode
you are reading, but the header block is written once, from chunk 0. Do not
re-emit `main_topics`, `guest_name`, `guest_affiliation` or `notes` on a later
chunk — chunk 0 is the only place they are read from.

### Header fields (chunk 0 only)

**`episode`** — from frontmatter. If frontmatter has no `episode` field, set
`null`; do not infer it from the filename or the cold open.

**`main_topics`** — 2 to 3 canonical concept names identifying what the video
is *about*, as opposed to what it merely mentions. Each must also appear as a
`concept` in `mentions`. Rank by airtime and depth, not by mention count — a
concept named forty times in passing is not a main topic.

This field is load-bearing for teardowns, repairs and reviews, which are the bulk
of the channel. **When the video has a device under test, name that device as the
first main topic**, as specifically as the title and audio support: prefer
`fluke-87v` over `multimeter`, `rigol-ds1054z` over `oscilloscope`. Fall back to
the general instrument only when no model is ever identified. Downstream stages
key the teardown pages off this field, so a teardown whose `main_topics` names
only the category has lost the article.

**`guest_name`** / **`guest_affiliation`** — the interviewee and the company or
institution they are introduced as representing. Both `null` on solo videos,
which is nearly all of them. If a guest gives no affiliation, set `guest_affiliation` to `null`
rather than guessing. Use the person's real name even when the speaker label is
corrupted (episode 650's guest is `Andreas Olofsson`, not `Parallela`).

**`notes`** — `null` normally. A one-sentence string when something about the
file itself would mislead a downstream consumer: broken speaker labels, missing
frontmatter, an unusually coarse paragraph structure, a truncated transcript.

### Mention objects

```json
{
  "concept": "solder-paste-stencil",
  "type": "tool-equipment",
  "speaker": "Chris Gammell",
  "paragraph_index": 363,
  "depth": "explains",
  "context_snippet": "tutorial on KiCad and how to actually create your own laser cut stencils"
}
```

`asr_suspect` is a fourth optional field, present only when `true` (see below).

## Field rules

### `concept`

A canonical-ish name for the thing being discussed.

- lowercase, hyphen-separated, ASCII only: `plated-through-hole`, `esp32-s2`,
  `field-oriented-control`.
- Must be a **self-contained noun phrase**. Never a pronoun, never a bare
  demonstrative, never a verb phrase.
- Singular, not plural: `stepper-motor`, not `stepper-motors`.
- Prefer the standard industry name over the speaker's slang. `scope` and
  `oscilloscope` both become `oscilloscope`.
- Do **not** merge distinct specificity levels. `msp430` and `msp430-launchpad`
  are separate concepts; `usb` and `usb-stack` are separate; `pcb-fabrication`
  and `pcb-milling` are separate.
- Companies keep their own name even when only a product is discussed, and vice
  versa: `digi-key`, `analog-discovery`, `texas-instruments`, `c2000`.

### `asr_suspect` and ASR corruption

These transcripts come from automatic speech recognition, which reliably mangles
proper nouns it does not know. This is the single largest source of bad canonical
names, so handle it explicitly:

- **If you can confidently recover the intended name from context**, canonicalise
  to the real name and let the `context_snippet` carry the verbatim garbled
  string as evidence. Do not set `asr_suspect`. Examples seen in this corpus:
  "Kycat" → `kicad`, "bomb consolidation" → `bom-consolidation`, "I penalized my
  board" → `panelization`, "Laura" → `lora`, "Sam's the roof" → `sam-zeloof`,
  "Vigilant" → `digilent`, "Adeptiva" → `adapteva`, "2.4 megahertz band" →
  `2-4-ghz-band`.
- **If the string is clearly a mangled proper noun but you cannot recover it with
  confidence**, keep the verbatim string as the concept (lowercased and
  hyphenated) and set `"asr_suspect": true`. A downstream pass will cluster these.
- **Never guess a plausible-sounding name you cannot support from context.** A
  wrong canonical name is worse than a flagged unknown one, because it merges
  silently into the wrong wiki article.

"Confidently recover" means the surrounding sentences pin the referent. "a 30s
PCI express 30s" is recoverable as `serdes` because the passage is explicitly
about PHY design effort; the bare token "30s" elsewhere would not be.

### `type`

Exactly one of the following sixteen.

| type | covers |
|---|---|
| `component` | physical parts and silicon: resistor, ESP32-S2, WIZnet module, op-amp, CMOS image sensor |
| `technique` | something an engineer *does to a design*: ground-pour, bit-banging, digital beamforming, hand soldering, current sensing |
| `tool-equipment` | instruments, machines, fixtures: oscilloscope, LPKF mill, reflow oven, EUV scanner, Analog Discovery |
| `software` | tools, languages, stacks, OSes, services: KiCad, Verilog, Zephyr, FreeRTOS, LWIP, Verilator, CDN |
| `company-product` | companies, distributors, institutions, agencies, and their named commercial offerings: Digi-Key, TI, DARPA, Rose-Hulman, Hubble, Kickstarter |
| `standard-protocol` | CAN, USB, I²C, PMBus, Gerber, DIN 3105, Bluetooth, AMBA/AXI, 10GbE |
| `manufacturing` | fab, assembly, packaging, supply chain, logistics, **and materials**: solder mask, panelisation, tape-out, wafer fab, lead time, Dibond, mylar, silicon interposer |
| `career` | the individual working life: jobs, hiring, interviews, titles, education, resumes, burnout, how people learn |
| `business-model` | how a company makes money: pricing, margins, licensing, monetisation, make-vs-buy, feature gating, product strategy |
| `industry-economics` | market-level forces: supply and demand, trade policy, the funding landscape, commoditisation, market sizing, capital barriers to entry |
| `engineering-practice` | how engineering *organisations* work: design-by-committee, the benevolent-dictator model, systems engineering process, code review culture, schedule slip, the limits of self-review |
| `community-event` | conferences, forums, meetups, movements: Maker Faire, DEF CON, Latch Up, TI E2E, open-source hardware |
| `media-resource` | books, app notes, videos, blogs, courses, datasheets, papers |
| `person` | named individuals discussed as subjects (authors, engineers, founders) — not the hosts introducing themselves |
| `concept-principle` | physical laws, phenomena, theory, rules of thumb: Ohm's law, fan-out, Miller plateau, Moore's law, path loss, angle of arrival, price elasticity |
| `other` | genuinely does not fit; use sparingly |

Pick the type by *what the passage is about*, not by the word's dictionary
category. "They ran out of 1.02K resistors at 2am" is `manufacturing` (a sourcing
story), not `component`.

Three boundaries that generate most of the coin-flips:

- **`technique` vs `engineering-practice`** — `technique` is what one engineer
  does to a circuit or a board; `engineering-practice` is how a team organises
  the work. Partitioning a schematic across pages is `technique`; deciding that
  one architect owns every decision is `engineering-practice`.
- **`business-model` vs `industry-economics`** — `business-model` is one
  company's choice; `industry-economics` is the environment every company faces.
  Charging a premium for ROM-resident IP is `business-model`; mask sets costing
  $20M is `industry-economics`.
- **`career` vs `engineering-practice`** — `career` follows a person;
  `engineering-practice` follows a process. "I spend 20 hours a week on the
  forums" is `career`; "you can't check your own stuff" is
  `engineering-practice`.

### `speaker`

The paragraph's label verbatim, without the asterisks or colon.

### `paragraph_index`

The global 0-based paragraph index, copied from the `[pN]` prefix on the
paragraph the mention occurs in.

There is no `char_start` field. The pipeline locates each mention by searching
for its `context_snippet` inside the paragraph you name, so the pair
(`paragraph_index`, `context_snippet`) is what anchors a mention to its evidence:
a snippet that is not found verbatim in its stated paragraph is rejected
automatically. Get the index and the verbatim text right and the offset takes
care of itself.

### `depth`

How much the passage actually teaches about the concept. Three values, in
descending order:

- **`explains`** — a reader who did not know the concept would learn something
  usable: a mechanism, a procedure, a trade-off *with its reason*, or a number
  with the context that makes it actionable.
- **`opinion`** — a judgement, preference, war story, or assertion about the
  concept, without the mechanism or reasoning that would let a reader apply it.
- **`mention`** — the concept is named and nothing more: a passing reference, a
  segue, a joke, an aside.

Worked calibration, taken from real extractions:

| passage | concept | depth | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| "chips have a certain drive capability. They can drive a certain amount of current whilst keeping a, the minimum low and high threshold levels required" | `fan-out` | `explains` | states the mechanism |
| "normally, you think of a byte as 8-bits. Well, actually, on our architecture, a byte is 16-bits" plus the struct-alignment consequence | `16-bit-byte-addressing` | `explains` | mechanism plus its downstream effect |
| "the magic figure is like $300. Once a product gets below the $300 threshold, it becomes an impulse buy" | `impulse-buy-price-threshold` | `explains` | a number with the context that makes it actionable |
| "I waited over a month for those, like five weeks... I'd already figured, oh no, I want to change things" | `pcb-lead-time` | `opinion` | a war story with a number, but no transferable rule |
| "Somebody has to run it and make all the decisions and be the dictator on the project" | `benevolent-dictator-model` | `opinion` | a strong position, no reasoning offered |
| "they've got much better quality sensors in them" | `image-sensor-quality` | `opinion` | bare assertion; borderline, and `opinion` is the right call |
| "that's what Freak Labs posted on Twitter the other day" | `freaklabs` | `mention` | named only |
| "you had your Google Glass on" | `google-glass` | `mention` | aside |

**Calibration anchor — this matters, do not skip it.** On a typical episode
expect roughly **a quarter to a third of mentions to be `explains`**, a little
under half `opinion`, and the balance `mention`. A v1 run of this prompt marked
95% of mentions as knowledge-bearing, which made the field useless as a
discriminator. If your `explains` share is drifting far above a third, you are
counting assertions as explanations — re-read the definition and tighten. If it
is far below a quarter on a technical interview, you are being too strict.

The share varies by episode: a deep single-subject interview runs at the high end
of the `explains` band, and a link-roundup episode runs at the low end. Do not
force the ratio on any individual episode — use it to check yourself.

### `context_snippet`

A verbatim substring of the paragraph, at most 100 characters, showing why you
tagged the mention. Trim to the informative part. Do not paraphrase, do not
insert `...` elisions, do not add the speaker label, do not include the `[pN]`
prefix.

> Pipeline note: both constraints are enforced downstream — a mention is rejected
> if `context_snippet` is longer than 100 characters or is not found verbatim
> inside the paragraph named by `paragraph_index`. The rules are stated here so
> you produce valid output, not because the validator is optional.

## Coverage rules

### 1. Extract every mention, not the interesting ones

A passing reference to Digi-Key is a mention. A full hour-long episode yields
150–300 mentions; hosts-only episodes run denser than interviews because they
cover more unrelated topics.

**Per-chunk yield anchor — this matters, do not skip it.** A typical
40-paragraph chunk should yield roughly **10 to 25 mentions**. Dense technical
stretches run higher and a chunk of pure banter runs lower, so do not pad to hit
the number — but a chunk that comes back with three or four mentions means you
skimmed, not that the chunk was empty. Before you finish, **sweep every
paragraph in the chunk in order**, from the first `[pN]` to the last, and ask of
each one what concepts it names. Short paragraphs are the ones most often
dropped, and there is no later pass that will pick them up: this chunk is the
only time these paragraphs are read.

### 2. The mention-emission rule is mechanical

Emit exactly one mention for a concept in a paragraph **if and only if** that
paragraph either:

- **names** the concept (in any surface form, including an ASR-mangled one), or
- refers to it by a pronoun or demonstrative whose referent is **unambiguously**
  the concept and is resolvable from that paragraph or the one immediately before
  it.

Otherwise emit nothing for that concept in that paragraph — even when the
paragraph is plainly part of the same conversational thread. Do not "carry
forward" a concept across a run of paragraphs because the topic has not changed,
and do not collapse a run into a single mention. Both distortions corrupt the
frequency ranking that decides which concepts get wiki articles.

Two consequences worth internalising: one dense paragraph can legitimately yield
fifteen mentions, and a paragraph that is only "Yeah." or "Right." yields none no
matter what it is agreeing with.

### 3. Skip sponsor-read segments entirely

A contiguous block of ad copy in marketing register, usually announced ("this
episode is brought to you by…", "our sponsor…") and closing with a discount code
or URL. Skip everything inside it, including the advertised product.

The hosts also promote their **own** businesses — EEVblog kits, Contextual
Electronics, listener donations, the show's hosting and app. That is **not** a
sponsor read. Extract it normally, usually as `business-model` and usually
`depth: "mention"`.

### 4. Do extract from small talk when it carries engineering content

Barbecue, gym classes and bad sci-fi films yield nothing. But a digression about
Chinese New Year factory shutdowns, university funding, PhD-student precarity, or
textbook pricing is real domain knowledge for this audience — extract it. This
rule is load-bearing: a naive small-talk filter would strip some of the corpus's
best `industry-economics` and `career` material.

### 5. Ignore the show's own furniture

The cold open ("hi, welcome to the EEVblog"), video numbering, calls to like and
subscribe, "link's in the description below", Patreon and sponsor plugs, forum
and mailbag-address readouts, sign-offs ("catch you next time"). These produce no
mentions.

One exception worth stating because it recurs: when Dave names the *sender* of a
mailbag item or the *supplier* of a piece of gear, that is a real
`company-product` or `person` mention, not furniture.

### 6. Skip the unrecoverable

If a concept appears only inside a garbled ASR run you cannot resolve *and* the
mangled string is not even clearly a proper noun, skip it rather than emit
nonsense. Use `asr_suspect` for the recoverable-but-uncertain middle ground.

## Few-shot examples

The `[pN]` prefixes below are shown exactly as they appear in a chunk; the
mentions carry those same numbers as `paragraph_index`.

---

**Example 1 — one dense paragraph, mixed depth.**

Input paragraph `[p21]` (episode 500):

> [p21] **Dave Jones:** Lowering the cost of assembly and lowering the cost, lowering
> the risk as well of sourcing parts and stuff like that. Because, you know,
> like you can just risk goofing it up if you can't get these. You're purchasing
> departments going around like crazy, trying to purchase 60 different reels of
> resistors. And, you know, oh, they ran out. You know, so you get a phone call
> at 2 a.m. in the morning from your assembly house because they're urgent, you
> know, in China.

Output:

```json
[
  {"concept": "bom-consolidation", "type": "technique", "speaker": "Dave Jones", "paragraph_index": 21, "depth": "explains", "context_snippet": "Lowering the cost of assembly and lowering the cost, lowering the risk as well of sourcing parts"},
  {"concept": "component-sourcing", "type": "manufacturing", "speaker": "Dave Jones", "paragraph_index": 21, "depth": "explains", "context_snippet": "purchasing departments going around like crazy, trying to purchase 60 different reels of resistors"},
  {"concept": "contract-assembly-house", "type": "manufacturing", "speaker": "Dave Jones", "paragraph_index": 21, "depth": "opinion", "context_snippet": "you get a phone call at 2 a.m. in the morning from your assembly house because they're urgent"}
]
```

Three mentions from one paragraph. `resistor` is **not** emitted separately — the
passage is about sourcing reels, not about resistors. The first two `explains`
because they give the reason a consolidated BOM lowers cost and risk; the third
is `opinion` because the 2am phone call is a war story, not a rule.

---

**Example 2 — the mechanical rule, including a paragraph that yields nothing.**

Input paragraphs `[p21]`–`[p23]` (episode 79):

> [p21] **Chris Gammell:** What about the limits? Is it 6-6? Six-line, six-space?
>
> [p22] **Dave Jones:** Yeah, it might be 6-6 or 5-5 or something like that.
> 0.3-millimeter hole, something like that. You know, fairly generic type stuff.
>
> [p23] **Chris Gammell:** Okay.

Output:

```json
[
  {"concept": "trace-width-and-spacing", "type": "manufacturing", "speaker": "Chris Gammell", "paragraph_index": 21, "depth": "opinion", "context_snippet": "What about the limits? Is it 6-6? Six-line, six-space?"},
  {"concept": "trace-width-and-spacing", "type": "manufacturing", "speaker": "Dave Jones", "paragraph_index": 22, "depth": "explains", "context_snippet": "it might be 6-6 or 5-5 or something like that"},
  {"concept": "drill-hole-size", "type": "manufacturing", "speaker": "Dave Jones", "paragraph_index": 22, "depth": "explains", "context_snippet": "0.3-millimeter hole, something like that. You know, fairly generic type stuff"}
]
```

Two things to take from this. `trace-width-and-spacing` is emitted **twice**,
once per paragraph that names it — the run is not collapsed into a single
mention. And paragraph `[p23]` emits **nothing**: "Okay." is unmistakably part of the
same exchange about PCB specs, but it neither names a concept nor contains a
resolvable pronoun, so the thread is not carried forward.

---

**Example 3 — ASR corruption, both branches.**

Input paragraph `[p74]` (episode 650):

> [p74] **Parallela:** if you say build versus buy, if I were to, uh, go out and
> design a 30s PCI express 30s, I would have to probably hire 10 people and, uh,
> you know, spend two years doing it. So if you look at us salaries, you know,
> say $200,000 per engineer times 10 times two, you're you're, you know, it takes
> you two years, you lost, lost time, and then you don't come out ahead in terms
> of cost.

Output:

```json
[
  {"concept": "build-vs-buy", "type": "business-model", "speaker": "Parallela", "paragraph_index": 74, "depth": "explains", "context_snippet": "say $200,000 per engineer times 10 times two, you're you're, you know, it takes you two years"},
  {"concept": "serdes", "type": "component", "speaker": "Parallela", "paragraph_index": 74, "depth": "explains", "context_snippet": "go out and design a 30s PCI express 30s, I would have to probably hire 10 people"},
  {"concept": "pci-express", "type": "standard-protocol", "speaker": "Parallela", "paragraph_index": 74, "depth": "opinion", "context_snippet": "go out and design a 30s PCI express 30s, I would have to probably hire 10 people"}
]
```

"30s" is ASR corruption of "SerDes", recoverable because the passage is
explicitly about the effort to design a PCI Express PHY — so it canonicalises to
`serdes` with **no** `asr_suspect` flag, and the snippet preserves the verbatim
garble as evidence. The speaker label `Parallela` is recorded verbatim even
though it is a product name, and the episode's `notes` field flags that.

Contrast a case where recovery is not confident:

```json
{"concept": "hans-kammensund", "type": "person", "speaker": "Chris Gammell", "paragraph_index": 216, "depth": "mention", "asr_suspect": true, "context_snippet": "Hans Kammensund, the 555 guy, he actually did one"}
```

Here "the 555 guy" strongly suggests Hans Camenzind, but the surname is mangled
past confident reconstruction, so the verbatim string is kept and flagged.

---

**Example 4 — a paragraph that yields nothing at all.**

Input paragraph `[p205]` (episode 500):

> [p205] **Chris Gammell:** Here's where Dave gets his PhD. This is where Dave goes back
> and he gets his PhD in this thing. Whatever it is. And he just, he just goes to
> conferences and argues with people for the rest of his frigging life. Dr.
> Jones. Yeah.

Output:

```json
[]
```

A running joke about the co-host. `phd` is not a concept mention here — the
passage is not about doctoral study, it is about Dave.

---

**Example 5 — the small-talk rule earning its place.**

Input paragraph `[p79]` (episode 500):

> [p79] **Dave Jones:** Almost half of Australian PhD students considering disengaging
> from studies due to the pandemic. Wow. This is like, yeah. They, they reckon 5%
> of PhD students in Australia are currently or about to experience homelessness
> and 11% are skipping meals.

Output:

```json
[
  {"concept": "phd-student-precarity", "type": "career", "speaker": "Dave Jones", "paragraph_index": 79, "depth": "explains", "context_snippet": "5% of PhD students in Australia are currently or about to experience homelessness"}
]
```

Off-topic by a naive filter, but this is exactly the industry-and-career material
the wiki should carry, and the numbers make it `explains`.
